# Login Functionality Issue and Solution

## Problem Identified

After thorough investigation, we discovered three key issues causing the login failure:

1. **API Response Structure Mismatch**: The frontend expected the tokens in a different structure (`tokens.accessToken`) than what the backend was returning (`access_token`).

2. **Port Configuration**: The backend was running on port 3006, but some frontend configurations were still pointing to port 3005.

3. **Email Verification**: The user account needs to be verified before login is allowed.

## Solution Implemented

We made the following changes to resolve the issues:

1. **Fixed Frontend-Backend Integration**:
   - Updated `apiAuth.ts` to correctly process the backend response format
   - Added proper error handling in the login controller
   - Enhanced debug logging throughout the authentication flow

2. **Added Robust JWT Configuration**:
   - Created a `.env.test` file with proper JWT configuration 
   - Set appropriate expiration settings for JWT tokens

3. **Verified User Accounts**:
   - Confirmed test users exist in the database and their email addresses are verified
   - Added password comparison testing to validate authentication flow

## Current Status

✅ The authentication service is working properly when tested directly
✅ Test users are verified and can successfully authenticate
✅ Port configuration has been unified to 3006
✅ JWT tokens are being generated properly

## How to Test

1. Ensure the backend server is running:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm run start:dev
   ```

2. Ensure the frontend is running:
   ```
   cd daawa
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Log in with valid test user credentials:
   - Email: `user@example.com`
   - Password: `password123`

## Additional Troubleshooting

If login issues persist:

1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify all backend environment variables are set correctly
3. Test the login API directly using Postman or curl:
   ```
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3006/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "password123"}'
   ```
4. Ensure CORS is properly configured to allow requests from the frontend

## Security Notes

- Test users with password `password123` should only be used in development
- In production, consider enforcing stronger password policies
- JWT tokens should have appropriate expiration settings
